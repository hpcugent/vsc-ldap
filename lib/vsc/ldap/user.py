"""
High-level tools for interacting with the LDAP for users.

@author: Andy Georges

The LdapUser class will bind to the LDAP server using LdapQuery, so
there is no need to do this manually.

If this code is extended, it should be Python 2.4 compatible until such time
as all machines where we might require LDAP accesss.

    Requires initialisation using a unique identification.

    It is important to realise that not all LDAP servers provide
    the same amount of information, some only provide a limited
    number of fields from the real (master) LDAP entry, since the
    machines they're running on typically need no more information
    and it is good practice keeping the provided amount of data
    to the minimum required for the the scripts to function in a
    proper manner.

    TL;DR Use a try/except block if you think the field might not
    be available.

        - request information from the LDAP by accessing instance fields
