Examples:

>>> f = LdapFilter("x=4")
>>> g = LdapFilter("y=5")
>>> h = LdapFilter("z=3")

>>> print "f = %s" % f

>>> print "g = %s" % g
g = (y=5)
>>> print "h = %s" % h
h = (z=3)

>>> print "f & g -> %s" % (f & g)
f & g -> (&(x=4)(y=5))
>>> print "f -> %s" % f
f -> (x=4)
>>> print "g -> %s" % g
g -> (y=5)

>>> print "(f & g) | h -> %s" % ((f & g) | h)
(f & g) | h -> (|(&(x=4)(y=5))(z=3))
>>> print "f & g | h -> %s" % (f & g | h)
f & g | h -> (|(&(x=4)(y=5))(z=3))
>>> print "f & (g | h) -> %s" % (f & (g | h))
f & (g | h) -> (&(x=4)(|(y=5)(z=3)))

>>> print "f & g & h -> %s" % (f & g & h)

>>> print "f & g & h | f -> %s" % (f & g & h | f)
f & g & h | f -> (|(&(x=4)(y=5)(z=3))(x=4))
>>> print "! f -> %s" % (f.negate())
! f -> (!(x=4) )

>>> print "fold & [f,g,h] -> %s" % LdapFilter.from_list(lambda x, y: x & y, [f, g, h])

    just that.
