"""
High-level tools for interacting with the LDAP for Virtual Organisations (VO).

@author: Andy Georges

The LdapVo class will bind to the LDAP server using LdapQuery, so
there is no need to do this manually.

If this code is extended, it should be Python 2.4 compatible until such time
as all machines where we might require LDAP accesss.
